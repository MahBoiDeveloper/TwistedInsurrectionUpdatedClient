# Twisted Insurrection Updated Client
Since the original authors have abandoned support for the mod by not updating the game, I decided to update the client configs so that the client can be updated with the latest chips that the community is developing.
Main features/improvements:
* Restored Discord app id;
* Add Russian language via client's L10N;
* Fixed individual mission selection.
## Installation
0. Download repository files
1. Drop them to the game folder and accept file replacing
2. Launch `TILauncher.exe`
3. ...
4. Profit!
